[[Open-Source]] [[Blockchain]] that uses [[Consensus protocol]] to validate transactions

## How it works

1. A transaction is sent to the [[Network]] 
2. Indenpendent validators ([[Nodes]]) compile them in a list of transactions they believe to be true
3. The validators exchange those lists in rounds and vote to accept or reject lists
4. A transaction is validated if the approval is of at least 80% of validators (if not reached they are dropped or reconsidered)
5. All the transactions are applied to the [[Ledger]]

This proccess is repeated every 3-5 seconds, making it an extremely fast to transaction

Every one of the [[Nodes]] need access to the whole [[XRP Ledger]] to validate
