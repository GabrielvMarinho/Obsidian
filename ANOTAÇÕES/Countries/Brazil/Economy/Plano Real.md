The Plano [[Real]] was launched in 1994 by [[Itamar Franco]] and was a ground breaking achievement, that was done looking forward to deal with [[Brazil]]s insanely high [[Inflation]] rates

## The history on why It was invented

[[Brazil]] has suffered with high [[Inflation]] rates for a long time though history, in the XX century, Brazil had 6 different [[Currency|Currencies]]

1. until 1942 - [[Réis]]
2. 1942-1967 - [[Primeiro Cruzeiro]]
3. 1967-1970 - [[Cruzeiro Novo]]
4.  1970-1986 - [[Cruzeiro (Second)]]
5. 1986-1989 - [[Cruzado]]
6. 1989-1990 - [[Cruzado Novo]]
7. 1990-1993 - [[Cruzeiro (Third)]]
8. 1993-1994 - [[Cruzeiro Real]]
9. 1994-20024 - [[Real]]

Brazil had so many coins because of a hiperinflation problem that led to [[Inflation]] rates up to 2.500% in one year

The country had such problems because of a high external public debt of the government

Plano real came in to get a coin once and for all, to try and solve hiper inflation with the help of international organizations and a lot of confidence

Brazil ended up "Solving it" to a point where we have only normal [[Inflation]] instead of a hiper one
