A mechanism to manage and store [[Cryptocurrency]], It can be a [[Hot Wallet]] or a [[Cold Wallet]]

Crypto wallets don't exactlty store anything, as every transacation is stored on the [[Blockchain]] and the crypto itself doesn't even existe, it shows you an interface that make it easier to transact and thats all

Generally, you dont access a cryptocurrency wallet when you are in an environment like a [[Crypto Exchange]], you have a private network that works similarly to a [[Lightning Network]] system, that's why you can go to [[Binance]] for example and buy and sell [[Bitcoin]] with fees lower than the bitcoin blockchain feed
