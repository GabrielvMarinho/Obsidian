The process of mining [[Bitcoin]] is done by [[Computer]]s all over the world, It works in a way so that every one of those computers have access to the [[Network]] and can validate transactions by solving math equations, you first need to solve those equations and waste a lot of energy by the way, before actually being able to validate a block, once you are the lucky one, you use your [[Hardware]] power to validate theses transactions that will be written in the [[Blockchain]], this makes the network safe since you would need acces to 51% of all computers mining bitcoin to actually make a fraudulent transaction.

Typically mining alone would require you computer to store the whole blockchain and every transaction ever done, currently you would need 515GB of storage to have it.
You don't need to have the whole blockchain only when you are mining in a [[Mining Pool]]
