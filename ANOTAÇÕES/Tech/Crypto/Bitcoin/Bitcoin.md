Bitcoin is a [[Descentralized]] [[Cryptocurrency]] based on the [[Blockchain]] created by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008, Bitcoins main idea was to create a new digital [[Currency]] where no government or organization owns.

Bitcoin is not meant to everyday transaction, bu more for storing and securing money
"Your bitcoins can be stored in your mind and thats enough"

## The genius behind It

Bitcoin archtecture is a very intelligent and different approach

It's based on [[Proof of Work]] which makes it runs by itself, every transaction that happens is validated and done by the people involved in [[Bitcoin Mining]] and by doing so, no [[Centralized]] organization ever needs to run It.

Since it uses [[Blockchain]] technology, no one actually owns anything, It's just stored in a [[Cryptocurrency Wallet]] and whoever has acess to it can control where the bitcoin will go next
## [[Supply]]

Bitcoin's supply is fixed at 21 millions bitcoins, making it a [[Deflation]] based currency since there will never be more than that number of bitcoins in the ecosytem. The number of bitcoins is distributed in the [[Network]] through the years and the ammount of bitcoin distributed is based on that date, As of 25/11/2024, the current supply of bitcoin is approximately 19.8 million units, the 21.000.000th bitcoin will be mined only in 2100, this control is based on [[Halving of Bitcoin]] 

## The [[Scalability]] Problem

Bitcoin presents a very clear scalability problem as It's transactions per second number is extremelly low, while we have [[Credit Card]] companies doing thousands of transactions per second, the bitcoin network only allows something close to 5-10 transactions per second, creating a system that can handle very low number of transactions relative to other means

Bitcoin has this low number of validation due to several reasons:
1. The time taken to validate a block from the blockchain (10 minutes)
2. The maximum storage of a single block (close to 2MB)

firstly, 1MB of data can storage a total of only 4000 transactions and since each block is created every 10 minutes it can only process 4000/10x60 = 6.6 transactions

Why not only add more MB or lower the time to validate a block?

It works as a triangle, where you have:
1. Descentralization
2. Speed
3. Safety

you can only have 2 at once and that's all, Bitcoin is safe and descentralized, the moment you ad block with fewer time to validate, for example, 10 seconds blocks, the Speed would go up but the safety of said transaction would go down. It make a lot when you stop and see that credit cards offers safe and fast services, but the are not descentralized


## The "Solution" to scalability

The solution proposed to help bitcoin overcome the scalability problem is to use the [[Lightning Network]]
