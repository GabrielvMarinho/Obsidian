A technique to give context to an [[Artificial Intelligence]] tool like [[LLMs]], where the model has access to a [[DataBase]] before generating or predicting something

It's a very cheap process since it doesn't require much [[Hardware]] power and doesn't change the models internal layers

A similar concept is [[Fine Tunning]], but is a way more expensive method to revaluate a models perceptin
