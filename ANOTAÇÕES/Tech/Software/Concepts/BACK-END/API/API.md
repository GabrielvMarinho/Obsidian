A set of services or [[Function]]s that enable two [[Software]] services to communicate with each other using definitions and specific [[Protocol]]s

Every API is based on an [[API Request]] and always gives at least an [[API Response]] to see if all went well, of course if the API return actual data the response will be different

APIs can be [[Synchronous]] or [[Asynchronous]], generally they are Asynchronous as it fits better actual use in production

Check the [[Method]]s for API interactions:
1. [[GET]]
2. [[POST]]
3. [[PUT]]
4. [[DELETE]]

responses:
- **200**: Success.
- **404**: Not Found.
- **500**: Server error.
