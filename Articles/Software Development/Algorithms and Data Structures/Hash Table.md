Implementing a Hash Table with Python.  
  
What is a Hash Table?  
  
A data structure that consists of keys and values, each key:value representing a point of data, hashtables utilizes hash functions to store each point of data into a specific position of an array. By doing so, the time of querying a value goes down to O(1).  
  
Implementation:  
  
The Implementation consists of a single python file with a class mirroring a hashtable's functionality, including setting values, querying values, resizing the hashtable's size and so on. The link for the code is in that github repo:
