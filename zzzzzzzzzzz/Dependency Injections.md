Programming technique that separates the construction of [Objects](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Tech%2FProgramming%2FProgramming%20Paradigms%2FOOP%2FConcepts%2FObject) from their usage

You can import [Objects](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Tech%2FProgramming%2FProgramming%20Paradigms%2FOOP%2FConcepts%2FObject) and [Functions](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Tech%2FProgramming%2FProgramming%20Tools%2FFunction) without creating them

It's used in [OOP](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Tech%2FProgramming%2FProgramming%20Paradigms%2FOOP%2FOOP) to reduce hardcoded dependencies between objects
