[This study](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/19/1277.abstract) shows that people with patellar tendon pain had huge ammounts of cortical inhibition, like if their motor cortexwas trying to limit the use of the quads.
A single set of of heav 70% [[MVC]] isometrics reduced the associated muscle inhibition, resulting in an increase in muscle strength, the times of hold were around 45%

When programming a solution for pattelar tendon pain, what i have seen John Evans doing it programming isometrics multiple times a day, every day, (these weeks usually are the first weeks of the knee-pain-solving-program), later on some elastic storage (drop jumps) are added, and then regaining strenght in motion by progressive overloading slow strength training, usually getting to less deep position to begin with, like slow quarter squats
