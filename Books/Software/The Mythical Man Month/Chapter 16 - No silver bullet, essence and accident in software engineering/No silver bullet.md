this chapter talks about productivity and being able to produce software faster as technologies to do so, evolves

the chapter makes an analogy to the product manager being a werewolf that can appear normal and familiar but becomes a monster in cases with tight schedule dates and necessity of making things faster, so the topic of the chapter is `what would be the silver bullet for that?`

We can separate the software aspects in `essence` and `accidental complexity`

the differences are, you cant abstract essence, if you need a program with memory management instructions, you cant simply opt to use a high level language without memory management, as you would be trying to abstract the essence, memory management becomes an accidental complexity when you just need to get data and pass it through a high level pipeline

## Irreducible essence of modern software

Complexity: Software has many different states, as a software scales, the complexity and possible states grow quickly, and complexity doesn't progress linearly.

Conformity: Software is usually described by a lot of different people, and the complexity is arbitrary 

Changeability: software is complex because its easy to change, therefore it may go through changes quickly, different from buildings or cars.

Invisibility: the fact that software parts become invisible to certain contributors as it grows, makes it easier to overlap functionalities or to conflict with each other. 

## Some abstractions of accidental difficulties

High level languages, time sharing, unified programming environment (like unix)
