Basically states that every system's first version suck, and you will thrown it away, either by creating a new implementation from scratch or by redesigning the system piece by piece, the argument is: you will throw something away anyway, why not plan it then?


Maintaining a system is expensive: with the ever increasing number of bugs, the number of fixes pile up, fixes itself don't necessarily solve any architectural flaw, that's why long running systems that don't go through a redesign tend to just get worse
