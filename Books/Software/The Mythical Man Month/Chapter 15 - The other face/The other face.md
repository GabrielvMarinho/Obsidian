this capter talks about documentation.

List of things a documentation should have:
1. Purpose of the program
2. Environment on which it can run
3. Domain and range of input and output
4. Functions and algorithsm used
5. Input and output format
6. operating instructions including normal and abnormal ending behaviour
7. Optiosn the user have of functions
8. Running time, the time for the program to do a task of specific size
9. accuracy and checking, how precisae the answers are expected

Every documentation of a system should have a suite of tests to verify functionality.

## Self documenting programs
one issue with documentation is that changes often happen on code but not on documentation, inline comments are a great form of "self documenting" programs, as the documentation is in the code itself, therefore more likely to be uptade (more likely, not surely)
