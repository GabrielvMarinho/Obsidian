this chapter was written 9 eyar after the no silver bullet chapter, and aims to see if the "no silver bullet" talk is really right, after almost a decade.

### Maybe some day software will be physics

physics are very complex but the complexity of a day becomes tomorrows order, maybe someday, software will discover new ordering principles like the three laws of thermodynamics, maybe not

### Where the complexity comes from 

Much of the complexity in a software construct is, however, not due to conformity to the external world but rather to the implementations itself, its data structures, algorithms, its connectivity.

### Just a good quote

Turski,

in IFIP Conference

>Of all misguided scientific endavours, none are more pathetic than the search for the philosopher's stone, a substance supposed to change base metals into gold, The supreme object of alchemy, ardently pursued by generations of researchers generously funded by secular and spiritual rulers, is an undiluted extract of wishful thinking, of the common assumption that things are as we would like them to be. It is a very human belief. It takes a lot of effort to accept the existence of insoluble problems. The wish to see a way out, against all ods, even when it is proven that it does not exist, is very, very strong. And most of us have a lot of sympathy for these courageous souls that try to achieve the impossible. And so it continues. Dissertations on squaring a circle are being written. Lotions to restore lost hair are concocted and well well. Methods to improve software productivity are hatched and sell very well
>All too oftern we are inclinied to follow our own optimist (or exploit the optmitic hopes of our sponsors). All too oftern we are willing to disregard the voice of reason and heed the siren calls of panacea pushers


### Jones's point

Focus on quality and producitivity will follow, he argues that most tasks in a late project are fixing things that were dont wrongly or malfunctions

### Object oriented

a problem that people working with object oriented tools is that they were though to deal with O-O as a set of tools to use, when its actually a form of design, way broader than the tools themselves
