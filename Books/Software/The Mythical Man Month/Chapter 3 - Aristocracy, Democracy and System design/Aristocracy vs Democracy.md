should the design of a system be done by a specified group of people or should the idea of the entire team be take into consideration?
the answer is it depends.

## Aristocracy

few architects decide the high level form of the system, while the implementers dont generally add much to it, this creates a concise product, giving the fact that there are few agreeing minds working together (notice i said a concise, not exactly good product, it can be pretty bad but concise), to the cost of not getting ideas from the implementers.

## Democracy

few architects decide the high level form of the system, while the implementers give feedback and contribute to the architecture, this likely creates a not so concise product, since the entire team is working within it, diverging technologies or philosophies might be choosen, with the pros of getting a lot of ideas on the board and seeing more opinions about the product
