When you are naming you software, the consist use of nouns it very important, lets say for example you will make to similar functions that have different implementations, you could call one: ``updateList``, you could call the other one ``reformListPartially``, even though the words update and reform are synonymous, it doesnt make much sense to use different name as its more likely that someone will not link both functions as similar.
