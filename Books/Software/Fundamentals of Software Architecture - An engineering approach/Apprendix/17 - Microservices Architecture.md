1. Why is the bounded context concept so critical for microservices architecture?
- 

2. What are three ways of determining if you have the right level of granularity in a
microservice?
- by purpose, transaction and choreography

3. What functionality might be contained within a sidecar?
- logging related

4. What is the difference between orchestration and choreography? Which does
microservices support? Is one communication style easier in microservices?
-  choreography: follows a workflow and no centrla mediator
- orchestration: managed by a central component
- both are supported orchestration is easier to coordinate a request and maintain observability

5. What is a saga in microservices?
- 

6. Why are agility, testability, and deployability so well supported in microservices?
- 

7. What are two reasons performance is usually an issue in microservices?
- network latency and multiple authentication within different services

8. Is microservices a domain-partitioned architecture or a technically partitioned
one?
- domain

9. Describe a topology where a microservices ecosystem might be only a single
quantum.
- 

10. How was domain reuse addressed in microservices? How was operational reuse
addressed?
-
