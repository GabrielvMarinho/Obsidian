1. Why is cyclomatic complexity such an important metric to analyze for architec‐
ture?
- because it shows how connascent components at a code level are

2. What is an architecture fitness function? How can they be used to analyze an
architecture?
- they certify the integrity of a software architecture characteristic

3. Provide an example of an architecture fitness function to measure the scalability
of an architecture.
- a function that makes asynchronous requests to a server multiple times in the same moment and measure the average response time

4. What is the most important criteria for an architecture characteristic to allow
architects and developers to create fitness functions?
- be measurable, you cant really measuer accessablity, you could more easily do it with elasticity
