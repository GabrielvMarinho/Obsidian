1. Describe the traditional approach of architecture versus development and
explain why that approach no longer works.
- developers separated from the software architect, this doesnt work because you need feedback, something the architect does may not reach the devs, and some stuff the devs make may never reach the architect

2. List the three levels of knowledge in the knowledge triangle and provide an
example of each.
- things you know: I know how an HTTP request work
- things you dont know: i dont know how to manage memory in C
- things you dont know you dont know: i have absolutely no idea how compilers even function

3. Why is it more important for an architect to focus on technical breadth rather
than technical depth?
- because an architect needs to build the high level plan of virtually everything in the system, so high level knowledge of many > low level knowledge of few
3. What are some of the ways of maintaining your technical depth and remaining

hands-on as an architect?
- participating in implementations with the development team and even taking some spare tasks in very critical architecture related software development
