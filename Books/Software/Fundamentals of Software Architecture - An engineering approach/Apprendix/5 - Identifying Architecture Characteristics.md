1. Give a reason why it is a good practice to limit the number of characteristics (“-
ilities”) an architecture should support.
- The more characteristcs a system must support, the more time the development team will spend to achieve them before actually solving the bussiness domain problem, and some times those ilities even overlap, making it virtually impossible to implement everything

2. True or false: most architecture characteristics come from business requirements
and user stories.
- True
3. If a business stakeholder states that time-to-market (i.e., getting new features and
bug fixes pushed out to users as fast as possible) is the most important business
concern, which architecture characteristics would the architecture need to sup‐
port?
- deployability
- testability
- modularity

4. What is the difference between scalability and elasticity?
- elasticity is a system being able to support spikes and lows while scalability is the ability of a system to scale to more users, not necessarily overnight 

5. You find out that your company is about to undergo several major acquisitions to
significantly increase its customer base. Which architectural characteristics
should you be worried about?
- configurability
- accessability
- scalability
