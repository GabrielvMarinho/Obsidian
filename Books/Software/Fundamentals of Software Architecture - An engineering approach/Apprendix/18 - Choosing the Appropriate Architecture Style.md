1. In what way does the data architecture (structure of the logical and physical data
models) influence the choice of architecture style?
- because it generally sets the way data is stored and passed around, which is directly correlated to the 

2. How does it influence your choice of architecture style to use?
- sometimes it impacts specific architecture ilities, specially if its an already existing data structure

3. Delineate the steps an architect uses to determine style of architecture, data parti‐
tioning, and communication styles.
- determine the -ilities, analyze if there are any existing data architecture, leverage different types of communcation, async or sync depending on the architecture's need

4. What factor leads an architect toward a distributed architecture?
- the need for specific attributes a non distributed system can have, such as deployability, agility, scalability
