A form of [[Web Authentication]] using sessions saved on the [Server](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Tech%2FHardware%2FConcepts%2FServer)

The server is responsible for saving all the sessions, if the server is restarted all the context is lost.

The main issue is that if your server is using a [Horizontal Scaling](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Tech%2FSoftware%2FSoftware%20Arquitecture%2FScaling%2FHorizontal%20Scaling) which is very common, you will have to configura it to have all the sessions centralized in a single machine and access to it
