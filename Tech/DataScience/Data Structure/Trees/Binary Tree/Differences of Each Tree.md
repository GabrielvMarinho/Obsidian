| Definition                     | A tree data structure where each node can have at most two children nodes. | A binary tree in which for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node. |
| Node Insertion                 | Nodes are inserted without any specific order.                             | Nodes are inserted according to their values, maintaining the BST property.                                                                                     |
| Node Lookup/Search             | No specific order; full tree traversal may be needed to find a node.       | Efficient lookup using the binary search property, reducing the search space by half at each step.                                                              |
| Time Complexity (average case) | O(n) for insertion, deletion, and search.                                  | O(h) for insertion, deletion, and search, where h is height.                                                                                                    |
| Space Complexity               | O(n) as it only depends on the number of nodes in the tree.                | O(n) as it only depends on the number of nodes in the tree.                                                                                                     |
| Application                    | Used in various tree-related algorithms and data structures.               | Ideal for applications where efficient search, insertion, and deletion are required, such as in databases and dictionaries                                      |
