[[Data Structure]] that implements a key value array like a dictionary, 

Time complexity of 0(1)
Space complexity of 0(n)

you generate a [[Hash]] based on the number you want to store, make it module of the length of the hash map, place it where the number points to.

so you can instantly know the key of the value, instead of having to iterate through it and checking every iteration 

Its very fast
