an algorithm to find a specific position in a sorted array

1. The algorithm will check for the current node, if Its higher or lower then the value being searched for (binary trees can be imagined as sorted arrays)
2. Lets say Its higher, that means the algorithm will go for the left node
3. the process repeat until you find the value

Time complexity of O(log n)
Space complexity of O(1)
