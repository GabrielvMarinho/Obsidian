A form of [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] that utilizes a diversity o learning methods like [[Reinforcement Learning]], [[Supervised Learning]] and [[Unsupervised Learning]] to train models to execute specific tasks

A generic approach to ML can look like this:
### Data collection

Can be [[Data]] stored in a [Sql](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Tech%2FDatabase%2FSql%20Databases%2FSql), [NoSql](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Tech%2FDatabase%2FNoSqlDatabases%2FNoSql) and [[Vectors]] [DataBase](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Tech%2FDatabase%2FDataBase)

### Data Analysis

The data is analyzed though different approaches

## Finding Pattern

Some sort of patern is found and registered for later use

## Prediction

The pattern is used for predictions 

## Decision Making

After predicting it goes through decision making processes, like validating if a photo contains a human face or not
