the process of taking physical resources like memory, a disk, processor and transforming into a virtual form of itself.


## Example of virtualization of the cpu

you might have a big number of processes, lets assume you have a single cpu unit, you need to run them concurrently, but how to share a physical resource seeminglessly among different processes? you could virtualize the cpu, it basically switches rapidly from process to process, giving the illusion of existing many cpus, when physically you have only one.
