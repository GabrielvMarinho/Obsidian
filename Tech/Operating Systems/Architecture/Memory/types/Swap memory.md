It's an extension of [[Physical memory]], it uses hd/ssd memory to make this extension

Notice that you can use swap memory when [[Physical memory]] is still available.
type:
```
free -h
```

you will see that even though the memory is not overflowing it uses swap space, this is generally done with less used processes, increasing efficiency
