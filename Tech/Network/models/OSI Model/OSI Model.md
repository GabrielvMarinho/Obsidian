Open systems interconnection, is a conceptual model of computer network divided in layers of function.

## Application
End user layer, the layer which the user interacts with the software application that itself implements some protocol for network communication.
## Presentation
layer responsible to formatting and translating data into a format specified by the application layer.
## Session
Controls the connections and sets a session between two or more computers, include logon (establishment) and logoff (termination)
## Transport
provides the functional and procedural means of transfering variable-length data sequences from a source host  to a destination host from one application to another across a network while maintaining the quality of service functions
## Network
transfering packets from one node to another connected in different networks. A network is a medium to which many nodes can be connected, on which every node has an address.
## Data Link
Provides node-to-node data transfer, a link between two directly connected nodes.
## Physical
The transmission and receiving of unstructured raw data between a device, such as an ethernet hub or network switch and a physical transmission medium.
Converts the bits into eletrical, radio or optical signals.
