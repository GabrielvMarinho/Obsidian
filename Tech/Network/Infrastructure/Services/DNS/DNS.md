Domain name system maps [[IP]]s into names.

even though dns has distributed servers, they have a consensus on whos names belong to each ip, this consensus is provided by authorities like [[ICANN]]


### WalkThrough

you query for a website: google.com
this is sent to a dns server: that will direct to a specific ip

### Buying a domain

technically if a domain doesnt exist you can just go and register it with ICANN, but that hard, generally you pay for a company to deal with that

once you buy it you have to indicate to what ip address the domain references too
