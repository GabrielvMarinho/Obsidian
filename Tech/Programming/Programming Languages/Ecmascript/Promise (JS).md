 An object generated by an [[Asynchronous]] function, it may resolve to a value in a point in time.

this is basically how an asynchronous function works:
```js
function getDataCallback(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("data from server");
  }, 1000);
}

console.log("Before request");

getDataCallback((result) => {
  console.log("Callback got:", result);
});

console.log("After request");
```

output:
```
Before request
After request
Callback got: data from server
```

1. The [[Event Loop]] will process the "before request"
2. The getDataCallback will be handled by a different thread, which will contain that callback function
3. The event loop will process the after request
4. Once the thread is finished, it invokes the callback function to the event loop, after the current stack is free
