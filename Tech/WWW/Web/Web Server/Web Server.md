A server for delivering web content, it usually runs on http meaning it can be considered a [[HTTP Server]] in those cases. However it can operate in different protocols to deliver that web content.

### Static Web Server
Delivers files as they are to the client, sends a static index.html for example (directly from a directory in the host machine).
### Dynamic Web Server
Delivers files dynamically, injecting data from a database/bussiness logic function, like fastapi, which is a framework for starting dynamic http servers.
