A server for delivering web content, it necessarily runs on [[HTTP|HTTP]], which is the standard for this task

Essentially:
1. Receives http requests
2. Processes http requests
3. Sends http responses 

### Static Web Server
Delivers files as they are to the client, sends a static index.html for example, maps physical files in a directory and sends them through http
### Dynamic Web Server
Delivers files dynamically, injecting data from a database/bussiness logic function, like fastapi, which is a framework for starting dynamic http servers.
